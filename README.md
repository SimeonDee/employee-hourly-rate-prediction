# employee-hourly-rate-prediction
This work encompasses Analysis, Prediction, Clustering and Classification. 

- **Analysis:** It contains detailed analysis of the employee wages and their geographical data
- **Regression:** Build regression models (LR, RFR, SVR and RR) for predicting employee hourly rate
- **Clustering:** Built Clustering models based on ```KMeans``` and ```DBSCAN``` for employee clustering
- **Classification:** Built Employee wage classifier models based on Radndom Forest Classifier ```RFC```, Support Vector Classifier ```SVC``` and Gradient Boosting Classifier ```GBC```for classifying employees as "well-paid" or "not-well-paid"
